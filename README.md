# Phase 1 Project Description

#The Purpose of this project is to identify low-risk aircraft suitable for initial investment in both commercial and private aviation operations
Aircraft accident and incident history is used as a proxy for operational, safety and financial risk
The final goal is to support the Head of Aviation Division in making data-driven fleet acquisition decisions that minimize risk while ensuring scalability and reliability.
Data&Methodology
The data contains historical aviation accident and incident records overtime. 
There are also specific variables that I have used since not all the data is relevant for the analysis.
Each aircraft type was evaluated using:
#1. Rate of fatal accidents
#2. Whether it was commercial or private
3. The number of fatalities per accident among other metrics
The aircraft with low fatal accidents, low severe or serious injuries and consistent operational usage are classified as low risk
## Analysis and Findings
#1. The sum of each Injury type was calculated and visualized showing that Fatal Injuries were the highest and most common type of injury
2. I plotted a bar chart of total injuries versus engine type and it suggested that the Turbojet engines are associated with the highest total injuries.
3. A bar chart of number of engines and total injuries also indicated that total injuries tend to increase with an increase in the number of engines.
4. We move on to risk evaluation by model and make. I grouped the data by Make, Model, and Purpose of flight to find the average total injuries. This data gives us aircraft models with the lowest average injuries. This indicates low-risk options.
5. The last thing I did was to analyse the data based on purpose of flight. The bar charts clearly showed that personal flights account for the highest number of fatal and total injuries, suggesting a higher risk in this category compared to others.
##  Recommendations
#Commercial and public aircrafts present lower total injuries as well as fatalities, which means it is a low safety risk aircraft.
#Private aviation represents the largest share of accidents probably due to experience. However, there are other aircrafts that offer lower fatal accidents and hence low safety risk. For operational risks we have to put the necessary steps in place to curb or lower them.
