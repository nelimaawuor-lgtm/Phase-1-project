# Phase 1 Project Description

#The Purpose of this project is to identify low-risk aircraft suitable for initial investment in both commercial and private aviation operations
Aircraft accident and incident history is used as a proxy for operational, safety and financial risk
The final goal is to support the Head of Aviation Division in making data-driven fleet acquisition decisions that minimize risk while ensuring scalability and reliability.
Data&Methodology
The data source is Historical aviation accident and incident records. 
There are also specific variables that I have used since not all the data is relevant for the analysis.
Each aircraft type was evaluated using:
1. Rate of fatal accidents
2. Whether it was commercial or private
3. The number of fatalities per accident among other metrics
The aircraft with low fatal accidents, low severe or serious injuries and consistent operational usage are classified as low risk
